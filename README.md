# Codacy gosec

A standalone tool that converts gosec results to Codacy's format. It allows the integration of gosec into your Codacy workflow.

## How it works

1.  The tool receives as input the gosec result from stdin. The gosec result must be in JSON format.

2.  Converts gosec result into Codacy's format

3.  Prints Codacy's format to stdout

> NOTE: the tool must be run in the project root folder.

## Usage

### Requirements

To get your gosec results into Codacy you'll need to:

-   [Enable Gosec](https://docs.codacy.com/repositories-configure/configuring-code-patterns/) and configure the corresponding code patterns on your repository **Code patterns** page
-   Enable the setting **Run analysis through build server** on your repository **Settings**, tab **General**, **Repository analysis**
-   Obtain a [project API token](https://docs.codacy.com/codacy-api/api-tokens/#project-api-tokens)
-   Install [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec#install)
-   Download the `codacy-gosec` binary (or Java jar) from [the releases page](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-gosec/releases)


### Sending the results to Codacy

Sending the results of running gosec to Codacy involves the steps below, which you can automate in your CI build process:

1.  Run gosec
2.  Convert the gosec output to a format that the Codacy API accepts using the [codacy-gosec](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-gosec/releases) binary
3.  Send the results to Codacy
4.  Finally, signal that Codacy can use the sent results and start a new analysis

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"

gosec -fmt json -log log.txt ./... | \
./codacy-gosec-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project-token: $PROJECT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H "project-token: $PROJECT_TOKEN" \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```

For self-hosted installations:

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"
export CODACY_URL="CODACY-INSTALLATION-URL"

gosec -fmt json -log log.txt ./... | \
./codacy-gosec-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project-token: $PROJECT_TOKEN"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H "project-token: $PROJECT_TOKEN" \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```
