# Codacy gosec

A standalone tool that converts gosec results to Codacy's format. It allows the integration of gosec into your Codacy workflow.

## How it works

1.  The tool receives as input the gosec result from stdin.

2.  Converts gosec result into Codacy's format

3.  Prints Codacy's format to stdout 

## Usage

The upload of results for a commit is done in two steps:

-   uploading all results
-   telling Codacy that it can run the rest of the analysis

For this a [project API](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207994675-Project-API) token is required.

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"

gosec -fmt json -log log.txt ./... | \
./codacy-gosec-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H 'project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN' \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"https://api.codacy.com/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```

For self-hosted installations:

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
export COMMIT="COMMIT-UUID"
export CODACY_URL="CODACY-INSTALLATION-URL"

gosec -fmt json -log log.txt ./... | \
./codacy-gosec-"<version>" | \
curl -XPOST -L -H "project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN"
    -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- \
    "$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/issuesRemoteResults"

curl -XPOST -L -H 'project_token: $PROJECT_TOKEN' \
	-H "Content-type: application/json" \
	"$CODACY_URL/2.0/commit/$COMMIT/resultsFinal"
```
